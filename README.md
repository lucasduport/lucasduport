# Hi there, I'm Lucas!

## About Me

I'm a French student currently studying Computer Engineering at EPITA, and I'm very passionate about technology. Although I haven't had the opportunity to complete an internship in the field of computer science, I have gained valuable experience in various fields through my previous summer jobs. I possess analytical and problem-solving skills, which I've honed through my academic studies. I have a strong work ethic, a willingness to learn, and the ability to adapt quickly to new environments. <br>
I'm excited to gain practical experience in the field of computer science and to work with a team of professionals who share my passion for technology.
